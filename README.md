# creature-tournament
This project was created to practice using the queue ADT and OOP in C++. The project is a game that simulates a tournament where the user creates two lineups with "Creatures" that fight each other.  The winner goes to the back of the lineup, the loser goes to the loser pile that is shared between both lineups. Results are printed to screen.
