# creature-tournament
This project was created to practice using the queue ADT and OOP in C++. The project is a game that simulates a tournament where the user creates two lineups with "Creatures" that fight each other. The creatures have predefined health and armor that must be implemented, and a "special power". The winner goes to the back of the lineup, the loser goes to the loser pile that is shared between both lineups. Results are printed to screen.

Blue Men - Strongest - Lots of defense, lose defense as they get weaker.

Harry Potter  - Next Strongest - Comes back to health once.

Vampire - Charm makes opponent not attack

Barbarian - No special powers.

Medusa - 1/12 chance she turns opponent to stone and wins.
